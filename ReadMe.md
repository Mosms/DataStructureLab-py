# Data Structure Lab

> Written by Bo Fu. From NJU.

## Intro

- This is a Python lab to implement some common data structures.

- The set of data structures may include

  - 基础数据结构 Elementary Data Structures(may not going to be implemented.)
    - Vector
    - Queue
    - Stack
    - Linked List
    - Rooted Simple Tree.

  - 树 Tree
    - 二叉搜索树 Binary Search Tree
    - 红黑树 Red-Black Tree.
    - B树 B Tree.
    - van Emde Boas Trees
  - 堆 Heap
    - 堆排序 Heap sort.
    - 优先级队列 Priority Queue.
    - 斐波那契堆 Fibonacci Heap.
  - 并查集 Disjoint Set
  - 哈希表 Hash Tables
    - Direct-address tables
    - Open addressing
    - Perfect hashing

- Actually, Python has already included most of the data structures and the basic structures such as **vector**, **queue** and **stack** etc. are even constructed as python's basic syntax, but looking at this lab itself, my real goal is to familiarize myself with **python** and go through the implementation of these data structures.

  So, I will not focus on the practicability but instead on the implementation itself, which aims to realize the reproduction of **Data Structure** theory(, though this lab's implementation will also have a certain degree of practicality).

## Update

- Now initially constructed and none of the data structures is implemented.
